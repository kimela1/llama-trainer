## Who am I?
* Junior at Oregon State University
* Aspiring front end developer
* 

## Why front end?
There is never a dull day while learning front-end development. For example, a to do list may be one of the most overdone app, but the app could be built so many different ways using different web technologies. The possibilites are seemingly endless and there is always more to learn. Even while working on this website I was able to experiment and learn new things. It's always exciting to try something new! Once I complete a project, I enjoy looking over my project and being able to see the effort I've put into it.

## Behind the scenes
* A fun, responsive, single-page web app
* With the help of media queries and flexbox, you can view this site anywhere at anytime
* Experimented with svg images, padding, and margins to create unique shapes for a fun background
* Used jQuery to simplify the animation of the scroll to top button
* Added some flair to the instruction section with some JavaScript
