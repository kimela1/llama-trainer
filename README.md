# llama trainer
Dealing with disobedience? No prob llama! Our experienced team has been training llamas for generations. We've seen and experienced it all! This guide will lay out exactly how to train your llama to be the perfect companion.

## Who am I?
* Junior at Oregon State University
* Aspiring front end developer
* Fascinated by the work that goes into creating and updating websites to improve the user experience

## Why front end?
There is never a dull day while learning front end development. The possibilites are seemingly endless and there is always more to learn. For example, a to do list may be one of the most overdone apps, but it can be built so many different ways with various web technologies. Even while working on this website I was able to experiment and learn new things. It's always exciting to tackle new challenges!

## Behind the scenes
* A fun, responsive, single-page website
* View this site anywhere, anytime with the help of media queries and flexbox
* Experimented with svg images, padding, and margins to create unique shapes for a fun background
* Used jQuery to simplify the animation of the scroll to top button
* Added some flair to the instruction section with some JavaScript
