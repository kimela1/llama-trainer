## Who am I?
* Junior at Oregon State University
* Aspiring front end developer
* 

## Why front end?
There is never a dull day while learning front end development. The possibilites are seemingly endless and there is always more to learn. For example, a to do list may be one of the most overdone apps, but it can be built so many different ways with various web technologies. Even while working on this site, I was able to experiment and learn new things. It's always exciting to try something new! Once a project is completed, it's always a satisfying moment to see the effort I've put into it.

## Behind the scenes
* A fun, responsive, single-page web app
* With the help of media queries and flexbox, you can view this site anywhere at anytime
* Experimented with svg images, padding, and margins to create unique shapes for a fun background
* Used jQuery to simplify the animation of the scroll to top button
* Added some flair to the instruction section with some JavaScript
