      <h2>What to expect</h2>
      <p> 
        Llamas are very intelligent animals who can learn many things, 
        and it is easy to train them. Every llama should know some basics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> To allow you to halter him quickly and easily</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> To walk along with you when on a leash, keeping the leash loose</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> To jump into a van, pickup, or trailer for transporting</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-check"></i> To let you handle their body, so you can do grooming or check injuries</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Training Facilities</h2>
        <p>
          We recommend having a catch pen. LLamas will happily enter and they can be held
          there safely and securely! If space allows, it would be great to have stables
          and dedicated training areas. We recommend an area at least 6'x6'. This will 
          provide enough room to catch the llama and manoeuvre them safely. Make sure
          there aren't any sharp edges that could injure you or your llama.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mySlides">
        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <p>
          Make sure you have the right equipment! You will need at least a halter that fits correctly and a good lead
          rope to fix onto the halter. There are other items that are desirable but not essential. 
          These non-essential items include a small bamboo cane to help guide the llama and
          a small bag to hold some feed for rewarding.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mySlides">
        <h2>Repetition</h2>
        <p>
          No matter what particular training exercise you are performing with your
          llamas, whether that is haltering, leading, desensitising, brushing, trekking,
          fitting a pack, etc, the exercise must be repeated over and over again until
          the llama fully understands and accepts what it is you are trying to get it
          to do (and that it will not be harmed in the process). Repeat frequently and
          keep your training sessions short and simple!

        <h2>Why Front End?</h2>
        <p>
          There is never a dull day while learning front end development. The possibilites are
          seemingly endless and there is always more to learn. For example,
          a to do list may be one of the most overdone apps, but it can be built
          so many different ways with various web technologies. Even while working on
          this website I was able to experiment and learn new things. It's always exciting
          to tackle new challenges!
